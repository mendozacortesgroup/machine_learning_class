    "We can understand this as follows, consider the function $F(P)$ and two different probability distributions $p$ and $q$. The inner product $q\\cdot Ap$ will be the potential gain in relative information between the function $F_p(P)$, sampling from probability distribution $p$, and the function $F_{q}(P)$, sampling from the distribution $q$. Similarly, $p\\cdot Ap$ is the potential gain in relative information when two functions sample the same probability distribution $p$. In essence, the dominance of the mixed state $q$ states, the potential gain of relative information can never increase when using a probability distribution different than $q$. This implies that the relative information $\\dfrac{d}{dt}I(q,p(t))$ can never increase as $p(t)$ evolves, and leaves us to interpret $\\dfrac{d}{dt}I(q,p(t))$ as the amount of information \"left to learn\" as the distribution of the pure states $p$ approaches the dominant mixed state $q$. In other words, the dominant mixed state $q$ is a steady-state solution and does not depend on time. "
