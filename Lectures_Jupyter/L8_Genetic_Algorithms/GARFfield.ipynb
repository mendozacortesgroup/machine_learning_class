    "Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for studying the physical movement of atoms and molecules. The atoms are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time. In the most common version the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined  by numerical solving Newton's equations of motion for a system of interacting particles, where forces between particles and their potential energies are often calculated using force fields. \n",

    "A good parameter set of a force field should be complete and transferable, which implies that the molecular mechanics model not only has the full parameters for most of the compounds, but also the parameters could be used in fittering binding of different atoms in different oxidation states and molecular neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For achieving this, is necessary simultaneous fitting of several parameters -per atom- describing intermolecular interactions may significantly improve the accuracy of force field description. Likewise, the reference data set needs to encompass all situations relevant to determining all of these parameters (and all combinations of them) uniquely. Such simultaneous force field fitting represents a technically challenging multiobjective optimization of the parameters of different physical nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure of parameterization is to optimize the cost function χ2, which is a sum of square of all deviations of calculated values, yi, respect to reference values, y0i. ωi in the equation are the weighting factors, which balance the contributions of different kinds of molecular properties. How to set ideal weights for different properties is also crucial for the success of the parameterization. \n",

The reference data of the molecular properties are mainly from experiments and now quantum mechanical calculations have become a more and more important resource, and some force fields rely mainly on high‐level ab initio data for the parameterization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these weights are quite arbitrary, cost function cannot be compared across different data sets, and not even within the same data set if the weights are varied. The only strictly meaningful application of an merit function value is its relative minimization within one series of optimization runs, for one and the same reference data set. \n",

    "No single solution exists that simultaneously optimizes each objective. In that case, the objective functions are said to be conflicting, and there exists a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions. A solution is called nondominated, Pareto optimal, Pareto efficient or noninferior, if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values. Without additional subjective preference information, all Pareto optimal solutions are considered equally good.\n",

    "A solution in X and the corresponding outcome is called Pareto optimal, if there does not exist another solution that dominates it. The set of Pareto optimal outcomes is often called the Pareto front, Pareto frontier, or Pareto boundary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gradient methods, as the simplest and most straightforward methods, are very useful if the molecular properties in question are a simple and clear functional of the force‐field parameter. However, in most of the cases, the first and the second derivatives are very difficult to calculate, even with numerical methods.\n",

A hybrid evolutionary, gradient based parameter optimization framework that allows multiobjetive fitness function specification, provides capabilities to enable exploration of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions, via hill -climbing and weight randomization of objetive functions. Nowadays there are several works reported in the literature using GA methods. \n",

Iteratively improved upon by two basic mechanisms: Information is interchanged between individuals via “crossover” in a “mating” process (two new individuals are generated from two old ones) and single individuals are modified by “mutation”, i.e., by changing part of the individual by some amount. The better ones get better chances to enter new rounds of mating, while the worse ones are eventually deleted from to pool. "

    "To improve convergence and speed of convergence, GARFfield includes an option to automatically switch from the evolutionary GA scheme to a conjugate gradient (Polak−Ribiere version) (CG) optimizer, when the GA is within the quadratic basin of a local minima in the PES. The CG operates on the single best accumulated force field string at the time of the GA−CG switch and proceeds by calculating the directional gradients from central finite differences of the force field parameters applied on the fitness function over the full training set. The CG option may be activated when the error change between iterations is within a threshold tolerance. GARFfield also provides a hill-climbing option that may be used to periodically test the existence of other minima.\n",
