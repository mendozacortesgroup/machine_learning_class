abstract = {We study the synchronization of a stochastically driven, current-based, integrate-and-fire neuronal model on a preferential-attachment network with scale-free characteristics and high clustering. The synchrony is induced by cascading total firing events where every neuron in the network fires at the same instant of time. We show that in the regime where the system remains in this highly synchronous state, the firing rate of the network is completely independent of the synaptic coupling, and depends solely on the external drive. On the other hand, the ability for the network to maintain synchrony depends on a balance between the fluctuations of the external input and the synaptic coupling strength. In order to accurately predict the probability of repeated cascading total firing events, we go beyond mean-field and treelike approximations and conduct a detailed second-order calculation taking into account local clustering. Our explicit analytical results are shown to give excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations for the particular preferential-attachment network model investigated.},

Using the random clustered network model, a generalisation of the Chung-Lurandom network model incorporating clustering, we examine the effect of clustering underthe Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic diffusion model with heterogeneouscontact rates. For this purpose, we exploit the branching process to analyse informationdiffusion in random unclustered networks with arbitrary contact rates, and provide noveliterative algorithms for estimating the conditions and sizes of global cascades,respectively. Showing that a random clustered network can be mapped into a factor graph,which is a locally tree-like structure, we successfully extend our analysis to randomclustered networks with heterogeneous contact rates. We then identify the conditions forphase transitions of information diffusion using our method. Interestingly, for variouscontact rates, we prove that random clustered networks with higher clustering coefficientshave strictly lower phase transition points for any given degree sequence. Finally, weconfirm our analytical results with numerical simulations of both synthetically-generatedand real-world networks.},

abstract = {The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of 10,000 or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist in which OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multi-scale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.},

abstract = {Synfire chains, sequences of pools linked by feedforward connections, support the propagation of precisely timed spike sequences, or synfire waves. An important question remains, how synfire chains can efficiently be embedded in cortical architecture. We present a model of synfire chain embedding in a cortical scale recurrent network using conductance-based synapses, balanced chains, and variable transmission delays. The network attains substantially higher embedding capacities than previous spiking neuron models and allows all its connections to be used for embedding. The number of waves in the model is regulated by recurrent background noise. We computationally explore the embedding capacity limit, and use a mean field analysis to describe the equilibrium state. Simulations confirm the mean field analysis over broad ranges of pool sizes and connectivity levels; the number of pools embedded in the system trades off against the firing rate and the number of waves. An optimal inhibition level balances the conflicting requirements of stable synfire propagation and limited response to background noise. A simplified analysis shows that the present conductance-based synapses achieve higher contrast between the responses to synfire input and background noise compared to current-based synapses, while regulation of wave numbers is traced to the use of variable transmission delays. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Though great advances in public health are witnessed world over in recent years, infectious diseases, besides insect vector-borne infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Control of the epidemics caused by the non-vector borne diseases such as tuberculosis, avian influenza (H5N1) and cryptococcus gattii, have left a very little hope in the past. The advancement of research in science and technology has paved way for the development of new tools and methodologies to fight against these diseases. In particular, intelligent technology and machine-learning based methodologies have rendered useful in developing more accurate predictive tools for the early diagnosis of these diseases. In all these endeavors the main focus is the understanding that the process of transmission of an infectious disease is nonlinear (not necessarily linear) and dynamical in character. This concept compels the appropriate quantification of the vital parameters that govern these dynamics. This book is ideal for a general science and engineering audience requiring an in-depth exposure to current issues, ideas, methods, and models. The topics discussed serve as a useful reference to clinical experts, health scientists, public health administrators, medical practioners, and senior undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, biology, bioinformatics, and epidemiology, medicine and health sciences.},

This mechanism was implemented on artificial neural networks, where a local learning step-size increases for coherent consecutive learning steps, and tested on a simple dataset of handwritten digits, MNIST. Based on our on-line learning results with a few handwriting examples, success rates for brain-inspired algorithms substantially outperform the commonly used ML algorithms. We speculate this emerging bridge from slow brain function to ML will promote ultrafast decision making under limited examples, which is the reality in many aspects of human activity, robotic control, and network optimization.},

abstract = {A time-dependent graph is, informally speaking, a graph structure dynamically changes with time. In such graphs, the weights associated with edges dynamically change over time, that is, the edges in such graphs are activated by sequences of time-dependent elements. Many real-life scenarios can be better modeled by time-dependent graphs, such as bioinformatics networks, transportation networks, and social networks. In particular, the time-dependent graph is a very broad concept, which is reflected in the related research with many names, including temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, historical graphs, and so on. Though static graphs have been extensively studied, for their time-dependent generalizations, we are still far from a complete and mature theory of models and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss the definition and topological structure of time-dependent graphs, as well as models for their relationship to dynamic systems. In addition, we review some classic problems on time-dependent graphs, e.g., route planning, social analysis, and subgraph problem (including matching and mining). We also introduce existing time-dependent systems and summarize their advantages and limitations. We try to keep the descriptions consistent as much as possible and we hope the survey can help practitioners to understand existing time-dependent techniques.},

abstract = {Most current Bayesian SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (or Recovered)) models either use exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, allow for a single distribution on the latent and infectious period, or make strong assumptions regarding the quantity of information available regarding time distributions, particularly the time spent in the exposed compartment. Many infectious diseases require a more realistic assumption on the latent and infectious periods. In this article, we provide an alternative model allowing general distributions to be utilized for both the exposed and infectious compartments, while avoiding the need for full latent time data. The alternative formulation is a path-specific SEIR (PS SEIR) model that follows individual paths through the exposed and infectious compartments, thereby removing the need for an exponential assumption on the latent and infectious time distributions. We show how the PS SEIR model is a stochastic analog to a general class of deterministic SEIR models. We then demonstrate the improvement of this PS SEIR model over more common population averaged models via simulation results and perform a new analysis of the Iowa mumps epidemic from 2006. {\textcopyright} 2013, The International Biometric Society.},

Ad-hoc system-level design methodologies, that lifts modeling to higher levels of abstraction, and the concept of intellectual property (IP), that promotes reuse of existing components, are essential steps to manage design complexity. However, the issue of compositional correctness arises with these steps. Given components from different manufacturers, designed with heterogeneous models, at different levels of abstraction, assembling them in a correct-by-construction manner is a difficult challenge. We address this challenge by proposing a process algebraic model to support system design with a formal model of computation and serve as a type system to capture the behavior of system components at the interface level. The proposed algebra is conceptually minimal, equipped with a formal semantics defined in a synchronous model of computation. It supports a scalable notion and a flexible degree of abstraction. We demonstrate its benefits by considering the type-based synthesis of latency-insensitive protocols, showing that the synthesis of component wrappers can be optimized by behavioral information carried by interface type descriptions and yield minimized stalls and maximized throughput.},

These include bond percolation, site percolation, k-core percolation, bootstrap percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts threshold model (WTM). We show that - except for bond percolation - each of these processes arises as a special case of the WTM, and bond percolation arises from a small modification. In fact "heterogeneous k-core percolation," a corresponding "heterogeneous bootstrap percolation" model, and the generalized epidemic process are completely equivalent to one another and the WTM. We further show that a natural generalization of the WTM in which individuals "transmit" or "send a message" to their neighbors with some probability less than 1 can be reformulated in terms of the WTM, and so this apparent generalization is in fact not more general. Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these results is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these other models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular case may in fact apply much more generally.},

abstract = {Much effort has been directed towards using mathematical models to understand and predict contagious disease, in particular Ebola outbreaks. Classical SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) compartmental models capture well the dynamics of the outbreak in certain communities, and accurately describe the differences between them based on a variety of parameters. However, repeated resurgence of Ebola contagions suggests that there are components of the global disease dynamics that we don't yet fully understand and can't effectively control. In order to understand the dynamics of a more widespread contagion, we placed SIR models within the framework of dynamic networks, with the communities at risk of contracting the virus acting as nonlinear systems, coupled based on a connectivity graph. We study how the effects of the disease (measured as the outbreak impact and duration) change with respect to local parameters, but also with changes in both short-range and long-range connectivity patterns in the graph. We discuss the implications of optimizing both these measures in increasingly realistic models of coupled communities.

abstract = {This textbook provides an exciting new addition to the area of network science featuring a stronger and more methodical link of models to their mathematical origin and explains how these relate to each other with special focus on epidemic spread on networks. The content of the book is at the interface of graph theory, stochastic processes and dynamical systems. The authors set out to make a significant contribution to closing the gap between model development and the supporting mathematics. This is done by: Summarising and presenting the state-of-the-art in modeling epidemics on networks with results and readily usable models signposted throughout the book; Presenting different mathematical approaches to formulate exact and solvable models; Identifying the concrete links between approximate models and their rigorous mathematical representation; Presenting a model hierarchy and clearly highlighting the links between model assumptions and model complexity; Providing a reference source for advanced undergraduate students, as well as doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers and academic experts who are engaged in modeling stochastic processes on networks; Providing software that can solve the differential equation models or directly simulate epidemics in networks. Replete with numerous diagrams, examples, instructive exercises, and online access to simulation algorithms and readily usable code, this book will appeal to a wide spectrum of readers from different backgrounds and academic levels. Appropriate for students with or without a strong background in mathematics, this textbook can form the basis of an advanced undergraduate or graduate course in both mathematics and biology departments alike.

abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology-from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids-can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via e-mail, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g.,the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks. The study of temporal networks is very interdisciplinary in nature. Reflecting this, even the object of study has many names-temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, time-aggregated graphs, time-stamped graphs, dynamic networks, dynamic graphs, dynamical graphs, and so on. This review covers different fields where temporal graphs are considered, but does not attempt to unify related terminology-rather, we want to make papers readable across disciplines. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Despite significant progress in our understanding of the brain at both microscopic and macroscopic scales, the mechanisms by which low-level neuronal behavior gives rise to high-level mental processes such as memory still remain unknown. In this paper, we assess the plausibility and quantify the performance of polychronization, a newly proposed mechanism of neuronal encoding, which has been suggested to underlie a wide range of cognitive phenomena. We then investigate the effect of network topology on the reliability with which input stimuli can be distinguished based on their encoding in the form of so-called polychronous groups or spatiotemporal patterns of spikes. We find that small-world networks perform an order of magnitude better than random ones, enabling reliable discrimination between inputs even when prompted by increasingly incomplete recall cues. Furthermore, we show that small-world architectures operate at significantly reduced energetic costs and that their memory capacity scales favorably with network size. Finally, we find that small-world topologies introduce biologically realistic constraints on the optimal input stimuli, favoring especially the topographic inputs known to exist in many cortical areas. Our results suggest that mammalian cortical networks, by virtue of being both small-world and topographically organized, seem particularly well-suited to information processing through polychronization. This article addresses the fundamental question of encoding in neuroscience. In particular, evidence is presented in support of an emerging model of neuronal encoding in the neocortex based on spatiotemporal patterns of spikes. {\textcopyright} HFSP Publishing.},

abstract = {Threshold models try to explain the consequences of social influence like the spread of fads and opinions. Along with models of epidemics, they constitute a major theoretical framework of social spreading processes. In threshold models on static networks, an individual changes her state if a certain fraction of her neighbors has done the same. When there are strong correlations in the temporal aspects of contact patterns, it is useful to represent the system as a temporal network. In such a system, not only contacts but also the time of the contacts are represented explicitly. In many cases, bursty temporal patterns slow down disease spreading. However, as we will see, this is not a universal truth for threshold models. In this work we propose an extension of Watts's classic threshold model to temporal networks. We do this by assuming that an agent is influenced by contacts which lie a certain time into the past. I.e., the individuals are affected by contacts within a time window. In addition to thresholds in the fraction of contacts, we also investigate the number of contacts within the time window as a basis for influence. To elucidate the model's behavior, we run the model on real and randomized empirical contact datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Calcium imaging of slices reveals reactivation of sequences of cells during the occurrence of repeated intracellular synaptic patterns. The spontaneous activity drifts with time, engaging different cells. Sequences of active neurons have distinct spatial structures and are repeated in the same order over tens of seconds, revealing modular temporal dynamics. Higher order sequences are replayed with compressed timing.},

abstract = {Percolation theory is most commonly associated with the slow flow of liquid through a porous medium, with applications to the physical sciences. Epidemiological applications have been anticipated for disease systems where the host is a plant or volume of soil, and hence is fixed in space. However, no natural examples have been reported. The central question of interest in percolation theory, the possibility of an infinite connected cluster, corresponds in infectious disease to a positive probability of an epidemic. Archived records of plague (infection with Yersinia pestis) in populations of great gerbils (Rhombomys opimus) in Kazakhstan have been used to show that epizootics only occur when more than about 0.33 of the burrow systems built by the host are occupied by family groups. The underlying mechanism for this abundance threshold is unknown. Here we present evidence that it is a percolation threshold, which arises from the difference in scale between the movements that transport infectious fleas between family groups and the vast size of contiguous landscapes colonized by gerbils. Conventional theory predicts that abundance thresholds for the spread of infectious disease arise when transmission between hosts is density dependent such that the basic reproduction number (R0) increases with abundance, attaining 1 at the threshold. Percolation thresholds, however, are separate, spatially explicit thresholds that indicate long-range connectivity in a system and do not coincide with R0 = 1. Abundance thresholds are the theoretical basis for attempts to manage infectious disease by reducing the abundance of susceptibles, including vaccination and the culling of wildlife. This first natural example of a percolation threshold in a disease system invites a re-appraisal of other invasion thresholds, such as those for epidemic viral infections in African lions (Panthera leo), and of other disease systems such as bovine tuberculosis (caused by Mycobacterium bovis) in badgers (Meles meles). {\textcopyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Conservation biologists, as well as veterinary and public health officials, would benefit greatly from being able to forecast whether outbreaks of infectious disease will be major. For values of the basic reproductive number (R0) between one and two, infectious disease outbreaks have a reasonable chance of either fading out at an early stage or, in the absence of intervention, spreading widely within the population. If it were possible to predict when fadeout was likely to occur, the need for costly precautionary control strategies could be minimized. However, the predictability of even simple epidemic processes remains largely unexplored. Here we conduct an examination of simulated data from the early stages of a fatal disease outbreak and explore how observable information might be useful for predicting major outbreaks. Specifically, would knowing the time of deaths for the first few cases allow us to predict whether an outbreak will be major? Using two approaches, trajectory matching and discriminant function analysis, we find that even in our best-case scenario (with accurate knowledge of epidemiological parameters, and precise times of death), it was not possible to reliably predict the outcome of a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Craft et al.},

abstract = {We explore the application of probability generating functions (PGFs) to invasive processes, focusing on infectious disease introduced into large populations. Our goal is to acquaint the reader with applications of PGFs, moreso than to derive new results. PGFs help predict a number of properties about early outbreak behavior while the population is still effectively infinite, including the probability of an epidemic, the size distribution after some number of generations, and the cumulative size distribution of non-epidemic outbreaks. We show how PGFs can be used in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, and discuss how to use these results to infer disease parameters from observed outbreaks. In the large population limit for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemics PGFs lead to survival-function based models that are equivalent to the usual mass-action SIR models but with fewer ODEs. We use these to explore properties such as the final size of epidemics or even the dynamics once stochastic effects are negligible. We target this primer at biologists and public health researchers with mathematical modeling experience who want to learn how to apply PGFs to invasive diseases, but it could also be used in an applications-based mathematics course on PGFs. We include many exercises to help demonstrate concepts and to give practice applying the results. We summarize our main results in a few tables. Additionally we provide a small python package which performs many of the relevant calculations.},

Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same {\$}R{\_}0{\$}. Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average {\$}R{\_}0{\$} and the underlying heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ({\$}R{\_}0{\$}) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond {\$}R{\_}0{\$} when predicting epidemic size.},

abstract = {On many social networking web sites such as Facebook and Twitter, resharing or reposting functionality allows users to share others' content with their own friends or followers. As content is reshared from user to user, large cascades of reshares can form. While a growing body of research has focused on analyzing and characterizing such cascades, a recent, parallel line of work has argued that the future trajectory of a cascade may be inherently unpredictable. In this work, we develop a framework for addressing cascade prediction problems. On a large sample of photo reshare cascades on Facebook, we find strong performance in predicting whether a cascade will continue to grow in the future. We find that the relative growth of a cascade becomes more predictable as we observe more of its reshares, that temporal and structural features are key predictors of cascade size, and that initially, breadth, rather than depth in a cascade is a better indicator of larger cascades. This prediction performance is robust in the sense that multiple distinct classes of features all achieve similar performance. We also discover that temporal features are predictive of a cascade's eventual shape. Observing independent cascades of the same content, we find that while these cascades differ greatly in size, we are still able to predict which ends up the largest.
